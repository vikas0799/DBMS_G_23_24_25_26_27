Stored Programs in MYSQL : - 
Stored programs in MySQL are precompiled SQL statements that are stored and executed on the database server.
Types of Stored Programs in MySQL : - 
Stored Procedures : - Stored Procedure is a named block of code that is stored in a database.This block of code can include
SQL queries , DML,DDL,DQL,DCL statements, collection type ,loops ,if-else statements etc.
A stored procedure in SQL is a group of SQL queries that can be saved and reused multiple times. It is very useful as it reduces the need for rewriting SQL queries

What is the purpose of Stored Procedures : - 
Code Reusability: -  Stored procedures allow you to write SQL queries or complex business logic once and reuse them multiple times throughout the application or by different users, reducing code duplication.
Performance Optimization :- Stored procedures are precompiled , which can lead to faster execution times.
 Security : - Stored procedures provide an additional layer of security by Restricting direct access to underlying database tables
Maintenance : - Logic is centralized in one place, making it easier to manage and update

Syntax to create a Procedure : - 


Delimiter $$
Create Procedure procedure_name (param_spec1, param_spec 2, …, param_spec n )
 Begin
 -- execution code 
End $$
Delimiter

A delimiter in SQL, specifically in MySQL, is a symbol or a set of characters that the MySQL database server uses to indicate the end of an SQL statement. By default, the delimiter in MySQL is a semicolon (;)

where each param_spec is of the form: 
[in | out | inout] parameter_name1 datatype , parameter_name2 datatype
– in mode: allows you to pass values into the procedure, 
– out mode: allows you to pass value back from procedure to the calling program
- INOUT: Can be used for both input and output. 


How to call procedure :
   CALL procedure_name();
Stored Procedure using without parameter : - 
Example :- create a stored procedure that retrieves all the data from the table.
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE get_all_employees()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
CALL get_all_employees();
