DML  Command : - DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manage and manipulate data within database tables.Here are the primary DML commands in SQL:
 INSERT: Adds new rows of data to a table.
 UPDATE: Modifies existing data within a table.
 DELETE: Removes rows of data from a table.

INSERT INTO Clause : -   The INSERT INTO statement of SQL is used to insert a new row in a table. There are two ways of using INSERT INTO statement for inserting rows:
   1. Only values: First method is to specify only the value of data to be inserted without the column names.

       Syntax : - INSERT INTO Table_name VALUES (Value1 , Value2 , Value3,.......)
       Table_name - name of the table
      Value1 - value of first column
      Value2 - value of second column

   2. Values with Column Name: In the second method we will specify both the columns which we want to fill and their corresponding values as shown below:
     Syntax:Syntax : - INSERT INTO Table_name(Column1 , column2 ……) VALUES (Value1 , Value2 , Value3,.......)
     Table_name - name of the table
     Value1 - value of first column
     Value2 - value of second column


Update Clause : - The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to update the data of an existing table in the database. 
     Syntax : - UPDATE table_name
                SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
                WHERE condition;


DELETE Clause : - The DELETE Statement in SQL is used to delete existing records from a table. We can delete a single record or multiple records depending on the condition we specify in the WHERE clause.
      Syntax : - DELETE FROM table_name
                 WHERE condition;

We cannot directly delete a single column value in SQL. Instead, we can set the column value to NULL or to another value, such as 0, depending on our requirements.
    Delete a Single Row
        DELETE FROM Table_name
        WHERE condition;

   Delete Multiple Rows
     Using the IN Operator
       DELETE FROM Table_name
       WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2 , ……);

     Using Multiple Conditions with OR
       DELETE FROM Table_name
       WHERE column1 = value1 OR column2= value2;

    Using a Range
       DELETE FROM Table_name
       WHERE column_name BETWEEN a AND b;   [a ,b] = Range
