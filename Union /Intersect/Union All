UNION : - The UNION operator combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It removes duplicate rows from the result set by default. 

Syntax :- SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;

To include duplicates, we can use UNION ALL.
Syntax :- SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;

INTERSECT
The INTERSECT operator returns the common rows from the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. Only rows that appear in both result sets are included.
Syntax : - SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
