JOINS :- Joins in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
INNER JOIN :- An INNER JOIN in SQL is used to retrieve rows from two or more tables that have matching values in specified columns. 
It returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
Syntax : - 
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

Let's use the employees and departments tables 
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT
);


CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);


INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department_id)
VALUES
(1, 'Ankit', 1),
(2, 'Monu', 2),
(3, 'Anish', 1),
(4, 'Vikas', NULL);


INSERT INTO departments (id, department_name)
VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'Engineering'),
(3, 'Marketing');


To retrieve the names of employees along with their department names
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;


Left Join : - A LEFT JOIN in SQL returns all records from the left table (the first table mentioned in the join), and the matched records from the right table (the second table mentioned in the join). If there is no match, the result is NULL from the right table.LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN.
Syntax : - 
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables

 if we want to get all the students and their corresponding course names.
Example : -   SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
                       FROM Students
                       LEFT JOIN Courses ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;


Right join : - A RIGHT JOIN in SQL returns all records from the right table (the second table mentioned in the join), and the matched records from the left table (the first table mentioned in the join). If there is no match, the result is NULL from the left table. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
Syntax : - 
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables


If we want to get all the courses and the names of students enrolled in those courses,
Example : -SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
RIGHT JOIN Courses ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;
